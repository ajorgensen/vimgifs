:x will write the current file only if there have been modifications to the file and then quit the window.<br>
:w will write the current file even if there haven't been any changes since the last write.<br>
To write all changed files and quit all windows you can use :xa.<br><br>
:x is equivalent to :xit, :exi, and :exit
