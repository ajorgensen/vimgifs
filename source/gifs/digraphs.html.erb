Digraphs allow you to insert characters not found on a standard keyboard.
The full list of available digraphs can be found by typing :dig<CR><br>
To use a digraph, type ctrl-k while in insert mode and then enter the two
characters. At the very least, it can save you from googling a unicode character
so you can cut and paste it.
